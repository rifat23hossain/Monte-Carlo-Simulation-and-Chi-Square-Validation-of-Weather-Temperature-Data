# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-and-Chi-Square-Validation-of-Weather-Temperature-Data
This project analyzes historical weather temperature data, visualizes its distribution, performs Monte Carlo simulation based on observed mean and standard deviation, and uses a Chi-Square test to compare simulated and observed distributions.
